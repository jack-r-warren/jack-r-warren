# Hello

I'm an undergraduate studying cybersecurity at [Northeastern University's Khoury College](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/). 

I'm interested in health and medical tech, currently on co-op doing software engineering at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). I was previously a development operations co-op at [Wolters Kluwer Health](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/health).
